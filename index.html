                    <p>The research includes the statistical study of a random phenomenon using satistical inference.
                        This inference is based on the establishment of the properties of the phenomenon by studying a
                        part of it. In other words, the study is structured with the propose of drawing conclusions
                        about the population parameter or parameters based on the value of an estimator obtained from
                        the sample data extracted from this population.</p>

                    <code>(Problem statement)</code>
                    <p>At this point, the question to be answered and the population of data associated with the
                        question must be clearly specified. The concepts must be precise and must place requirements
                        appropiate to the problem that are motivated by the time, money available and the skill of
                        the investigators.</p>
                        <p>Some concepts such as defective item, economical, salary, may vary in
                        each case and for each problem we must coincide with the ideas indicated in the study.</p>

                    <code>(Modeling)</code>
                    <p>This aspect is of great importance, since data collection requires money and time, it is always
                        our desire to obtain the maximum information with the minumum cost possible. Including excessive
                        information in the sample is often costly and uneconomical. Including little is also
                        unsatisfactory. This implies, among other things, that we must determine the size of the sample
                        or the amount or type of data that allows us to solve the problem in the most efficient way.</p>

                    <code>(Exploration)</code>
                    <p>This part in general, is the one that requires the most time in the investigation. This
                        collection must comply with scrict rules since we hope to extract to desired information from
                        the data.</p>

                    <header><b>4 Results tabulation</b></header>
                    <code>(Sequencing)</code>
                    <p>At this stage, the sample data are clearly exposed and illustrated with tabular and graphical
                        representations (diagrams, histograms, etc.), in addition, the statistical measures appropriate
                        the inferential process that has been chosen are calculated.</p>

                    <code>(Prediction)</code>
                    <p>This last step constitutes perhaps the most important contribution of statistics to the
                        inferential process. Here the level of reliability for inference is set; This is because the
                        conclusions derived from statistical inferences can never be taken with 100% certainty, but a
                        level of reliability can be associated with them, in terms of probability called confidence
                        level and significance level.</p>
                    <p>The inferential process will lead us to a statistical conclusion that will serve as guidance to
                        who or who should make the decision (administrative or clinical) on the subject under study.</p>
